      <span class="byline">Words and music by Amy Carol Wolff</span>
</p>
<p>  
      To those who see the widowed<br />
      The infected and abused<br />
      To those who hear them asking for deliverance<br />
      To those who are angered<br />
      By the failed attempts at progress<br />
      And are inspired to give the forgotten their voice<br />
</p>
<p>  
      Show them there&rsquo;s a brighter way<br />
      A rushing river gaining ground<br />
      Bringing life and hope abound<br />
      A brighter love,<br />
      One that reaches deep enough<br />
      To see their pain and lift them up in grace<br />
      This is purpose<br />
      For this we sing.<br />
</p>
<p>  
      We must join together<br />
      Hear the cries of the hopeful<br />
      Who know there is power in our passion<br />
      Committing to this calling<br />
      To be one in our mission, empowering with life<br />
</p>
<p>  
      Show them there&rsquo;s a brighter way<br />
      A rushing river gaining ground<br />
      Bringing life and hope abound<br />
      A brighter love,<br />
      One that reaches deep enough<br />
      To see their pain and lift them up in grace<br />
      This is purpose<br />
      For this we sing.<br />
</p>
<p>  
      This is our noble battle,<br />
      Our adventure finding beauty,<br />
      In the eyes of a child, in the callused hands of poverty<br />
      We will not settle for signed paper contracts<br />
      We will move, inspiring others to believe<br />
      Show them there&rsquo;s a brighter way<br />
      A brighter love, oh<br />
</p>

<p>      
      Show them there&rsquo;s a brighter way<br />
      A rushing river gaining ground<br />
      Bringing life and hope abound<br />
      A brighter love,<br />
      One that reaches deep enough<br />
      To see their pain and lift them up in grace<br />
      This is purpose<br />
      For this we sing.<br />
      For this we sing.<br />
      For those who see
