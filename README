Intro
=====

This is a lyrics scroller we built at zyozy for one of our projects.

It's got bookmarks, which are essentially logical times in the song for the scroller to scroll so that it's easy to sing along with.

Implement it using the simple options hash below; for more info, clone the repo or browse the files for some (rudimentary right now) documentation.
